GitFit is a cross-platform mobile application built with React Native that allows users to upload videos of them performing a variety of weight-lifting exercises, and compare it to a professional's technique. The video of the user is superimposed and scaled on top of the video of the professional to identify key differences between lifts to correct form, and reduce chance of injury.
